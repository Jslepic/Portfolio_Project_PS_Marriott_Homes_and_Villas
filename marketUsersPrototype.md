These websites are relevant comparisons as they are based anywhere in the world and showcase spots in different countries. Moreover, they have common features and options for users to search and learn more about different rental homes or vacation spots that users can potentially visit. They give users options to plan out and pick their next potential vacation by specifying locations and dates. Moreover, they allow users to choose and define what kind of accommodations they are looking for for their party.

## Understand Your Users
*Write a short paragraph (50-100 words) describing the themes that emerged from the user research*
When users go online to look for places to visit and stay, they look for a location, what type of vacation to enjoy, or both at once. Therefore, when people go on a website like the Marriott, having a suggested list of popular places and attractions would be good. Moreover, when they have the destination in mind, when they are looking for a rental place, they want to specify what kind of lodgings they want for any number of people and with certain amenities.
